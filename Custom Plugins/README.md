<h2>Custom Plugins</h2>
<p>This area contains plugins which were created by the SyncAdmin developer community and have been reviewed and verified by the SyncAdmin Content Team which you can use in the <a href="http://www.roblox.com/library/549677290/SyncAdmin">SyncAdmin Loader</a>.</p>

<h2>Installing Plugins</h2>
<p>1. First, you'll need to open up the "Plugins" diretory found inside the loader.</p>

<p>2. Once you've found the plugins directory, create a <a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/ModuleScript">ModuleScript</a> inside the plugins directory.</p>
<img src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/RhyCkZB3SL6yH6_bLGaS3g.png">

<p>3. The new ModuleScript you just created will open up in the Studio editor. Just put the source to your plugin in here.
<br>More information regarding the SyncAdmin developer API can be found <a href="https://github.com/DataSynchronized/SyncAdmin/wiki">here</a>.</p>

> **Note:** You will see other folders such as administration, donator, fun, etc. inside the plugins directory. Don't worry about those. 
> They're just there for organisation and can be renamed to whatever you want if you have a different organisation method.
