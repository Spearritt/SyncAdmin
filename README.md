<p align="center">All the features you need to easily manage your Roblox game!</p>
<hr>

<h2>Studio Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>1. First, you'll need the SyncAdmin model found <a href="http://www.roblox.com/library/549677290/SyncAdmin">here</a></p>

<p>2. Once you've got the SyncAdmin model, you'll need to insert it into your place via Roblox Studio</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> We highly recommend inserting it into <a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.phptitle=API:Class/ServerScriptService">ServerScriptService</a> for security</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3. Finally, let's make sure <a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/HttpService">HttpService</a> is enabled by checking if the HttpEnabled property is enabled <b>then move on to the in-game installation instructions.</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> You do not need to add yourself to the admin list as the game owner is granted level 3 (super administrator) permissions automatically. However, if you need to add developers, etc. to your game, make sure to open the Settings module found inside the SyncAdmin loader and edit the BaseAdmins setting. More information found (here when there's a wiki page for it).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>In-Game Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>1. While in game, if you are the game owner or have level 3 permissions (super administrator) then run the !!settings command - (Prefix may be different)

<p>2. Once you've ran the settings command, a settings window will open up like below:</p>

<p>3. Change the values you want and once you're done, just click "Save & Close" or "Apply" to save your settings.

<h2>Installing Custom Plugins</h2>
<p>SyncAdmin allows you to create, share and modify plugins for the system itself. This little guide will explain how to install custom plugins for your SyncAdmin setup</p>

<p>1. First, you'll need to create a new <a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/ModuleScript">ModuleScript</a> inside the "Plugins" folder inside the SyncAdmin loader.</p>

<p>2. Once you've done that, you'll then need to put the source into the ModuleScript you just created. More information found <a href="https://github.com/DataSynchronized/SyncAdmin/wiki">here</a> regarding the SyncAdmin developer API, etc.</p>

<p>3. Finally, once you've finished putting the source to your custom plugin inside the ModuleScript, make sure the ModuleScript name is the name of the command you'd like to name it. E.g. Name it "Fly" so when you type "!!fly me" it will load the plugin named "Fly"</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Inside the "Plugins" folder, you will see other folders such as fun, administration, etc. These are not important. They're purely there for organisation and you can name them as you like if you want to organise your plugins another way.</p>
